## Publications and reports

**[Statistical Inference Toolkit in R: Hypothesis Tests, Regression & Simulation](documents/Statistics_R.pdf){:target="_blank"}**

_December 2025_

Completed a technical assignment applying statistical tools like hypothesis testing, regression interpretation (including interactions / diff-in-diff logic), and Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate power and sample-size effects, documenting both the write-up and reproducible R workflow.

**[Plastic Packaging Tax — Microeconomic Policy Evaluation (Illinois)](documents/Analysis_Micro_PPT.pdf){:target="_blank"}**

_November 2025 | In collaboration with Coelho N. and Li, M._

Built a technical report evaluating a proposed plastic packaging tax using a welfare framework—deriving the Pigouvian benchmark, modeling market equilibrium, and assessing efficiency and incidence.

**[Replication of CBO Distributional Analysis: “Big Beautiful Bill”](documents/Statistics_BBB.pdf){:target="_blank"}**

_October 2025_
![hist](images/BBB_hist.png)!

Recreated key distributional charts from a Congressional Budget Office memo on the “Big Beautiful Bill” by building a reproducible R workflow—cleaning CPS-based microdata, constructing the CBO income concept (income + transfers − taxes), computing deciles, and aggregating policy-induced changes in household resources to match the memo’s figure logic.
