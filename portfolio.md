Here you can find a sample of different projects and publications I have worked on throughout my career that might be relevant. Unfortunately, due to NDAs and confidentiality agreements, I cannot share plenty of relevant work that I have developed during the years as a consultant, but I am happy to discuss more details upon request.

## Open publications

#### [Atopic Dermatitis: Beyond the Skin. Impact on quality of life in México](https://fundacionidea.org.mx/publication_detail/84){:target="_blank"}
_May 2024 | Fundación IDEA_

During my time as a senior analyst at Fundación IDEA, I co-authored this report on atopic dermatitis in México. The publication delves into the multifaceted impact of AD on patients' quality of life, encompassing physical discomfort, psychological effects, and social implications. It also highlights the economic burden associated with the disease, including direct medical costs and indirect costs. My responsibilities included the design of the methdology and surveys, executing interviews and data recollection, as well as performing descriptive statistical analysis and data visualization (exclusively in Python), as well as the writing of the report.

## Personal projects

#### [DataCol](https://github.com/jballesterosc/datacol_backup/tree/main/_backup){:target="_blank"}
_2020 | Python_

A personal project to scrape and analyze data from COVID-19 reports in Colima, México. The project involved data cleaning, visualization and descriptive statistics to understand the spread and impact of the virus in the state. The main milestone of this project was that I received an award from the state government to support the development of a web application to visualize the data and provide real-time updates to the public. The final outcome, was the transfer of the entire application to the government, specifically the Ministry of Health of Colima.

Another take-away, is that I developed this platform in the pre-chatGPT era, so most of the code was written from scratch. This was super useful to enhance both my programming skills in Python and my understanding of data analysis workflows.

## Recent technical assignments

#### [Statistical Inference Toolkit in R: Hypothesis Tests, Regression & Simulation](documents/Statistics_R.pdf){:target="_blank"}
_December 2025 | R _

Completed a technical assignment applying statistical tools like hypothesis testing, regression interpretation (including interactions / diff-in-diff logic), and Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate power and sample-size effects, documenting both the write-up and reproducible R workflow.

#### [Plastic Packaging Tax — Microeconomic Policy Evaluation (Illinois)](documents/Analysis_Micro_PPT.pdf){:target="_blank"}
_November 2025 | R | In collaboration with Coelho N. and Li, M._

Built a technical report evaluating a proposed plastic packaging tax using a welfare framework—deriving the Pigouvian benchmark, modeling market equilibrium, and assessing efficiency and incidence.

#### [Replication of CBO Distributional Analysis: “Big Beautiful Bill”](documents/Statistics_BBB.pdf){:target="_blank"}
_October 2025 | R_

Recreated key distributional charts from a Congressional Budget Office memo on the “Big Beautiful Bill” by building a reproducible R workflow—cleaning CPS-based microdata, constructing the CBO income concept (income + transfers − taxes), computing deciles, and aggregating policy-induced changes in household resources to match the memo’s figure logic.
