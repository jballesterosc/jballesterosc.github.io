## about me
I am an Economics PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/mmontoya){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [David Margolis](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/margolis-david/){:target="_blank"}. Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, working with [Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com/){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on development economics, with an emphasis on the intersection of labor and crime economics. I am currently studying how organized crime affects local labor markets in Mexico and exploring strategies to encourage youth to invest in education in similar contexts.

In addition to my research, I work as a consultant and trainer in project and data management for social science research projects. I assist research teams in establishing workflows for data management, project collaboration, and documentation, ensuring their work is replicable and reproducible. I also [teach how to use R, Stata and GitHub](https://github.com/mariamontoyaa/2023-intro-to-R-public). Interested? [E-mail me](mailto:maria.montoya.aguirre@gmail.com) for more information. 

I previously served as an Economic Analyst at the [United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/){:target="_blank"} (UNDP), where I contributed to reports on social protection challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the World Bank Development Research Group alongside [Lelys Dinarte](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/l/lelys-dinarte){:target="_blank"}.
