------------------

I am a Master of Public Policy (MPP) candidate at the University of Chicago, focused on data analytics, economics, and policy. I have a background in international relations and 9+ years of consulting experience supporting governments, nonprofits, and private sector clients across Latin America and the Caribbean. My work spans both analysis and build, translating messy problems into practical solutions such as tools, workflows, and decision systems that improve how teams plan, execute, and measure results.

I combine structured problem solving with technical skills in Python, R, SQL, and Looker Studio to build end to end data solutions, from data extraction and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and decision ready reporting.

Previously, I worked at [DiDi Global Inc.](https://web.didiglobal.com/), [Fundación IDEA](https://fundacionidea.org.mx/), [C230 Consulting](https://c-230.com/), and the [International Republican Institute](https://www.iri.org/), among others. And I've delivered projects for clients including the [U.S. Department of State](https://2021-2025.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs-work-by-country/mexico-summary/), [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.com/es/mexico), [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/), [Chemonics](https://www.chemonics.com/), [AMEXCID](https://www.gob.mx/amexcid) [Fundación Amparo](https://www.fundacionamparo.com/) and multiple state governments in México
