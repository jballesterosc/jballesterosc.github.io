## about me

I am a Master of Public Policy (MPP) candidate at the University of Chicago, with a focus on data analytics and tech. I have a background in international relations, and more than eight years of experience in consulting, turning complex data into high-impact decisions for governments, non-profits, and private sector clients across Latin America and the Caribbean. 

I combine structured problem-solving with technical skills like Python, R, SQL, and Looker Studio to develop end-to-end data solutions that drive strategic insights and operational efficiency.

Currently, in the University of Chicago, I am taking coursework related to data science, public policy analysis, and economics.
